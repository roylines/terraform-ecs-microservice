# terraform-ecs-microservice
Latest release: *v1.0.0*

A terraform module for creating a microservice within an ECS cluster.
It will create all the necessary tasks, and will create an ELB in front of each service. 
Additionally a record will be added to the [private hosted zone](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html) allowing simple service discovery.
There are several [variables](https://github.com/roylines/terraform-ecs-microservice/blob/master/variables.tf) that can be set to configure, for example, the port and desired count of services.

This module is normally used in conjunction with (https://github.com/roylines/terraform-ecs)[https://github.com/roylines/terraform-ecs] 

# Usage 
Instructions for using terraform modules can be found within the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html)
It is strongly recommended that when using this module, you use versioned links to the repository.

The following minimal terraform template example will create the cluster using the supplied ssh public key.

```
variable "vpc" {
  description = "the name to use for the vpc"
}
variable "ssh_public_key" {
  description = "the public key to allow ssh access to the clustered instances"
}

module "ecs" {
  vpc = "${var.vpc}"
  source = "git::https://github.com/roylines/terraform-ecs?ref=v2.0.0" 
  ssh_public_key = "${var.ssh_public_key}"
}

module "my_microservice" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/roylines/terraform-ecs-microservice?ref=v1.0.0" 
  // don't change these
  vpc_id = "${module.ecs.vpc_id}"
  vpc = "${var.vpc}"
  subnets = "${module.ecs.subnets}"
  cluster_id = "${module.ecs.cluster_id}"
  private_zone_id = "${module.ecs.private_zone_id}"
  
  // you can change these
  name = "my-micro"
  image = "roylines/nginx"
  port = 8001
  desired_count = 1
}
```
